# GitHub-Portfolio

DESCRIPTION:
---------------------

A public repository where potential employers can view my personal sample projects and review my C# skills. 

The titles of the Solutions are meant to be self descriptive and tell what the overall project
is intended to primarily demonstrate. 

Each Solution has it's own class library, and I have included a console app as well as an MVC web app (in 
some projects) to demonstrate output and functionality. 


REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------

Visual Studio 2019 running on Windows 10


INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------

1. Do a git clone of the entire "GitHub-Portfolio" repository on any directory of your choice on your local computer.

2. Inside of the local repository folder of the GitHub-Portfolio, choose from the list of any of solution folders.

3. Open a solution folder, and double-click on the "(SolutionName).sln" file at the bottom of the folder to open the 
entire solution (opens with Visual Studio).

4. Some solutions have an MVC web app and/or a console app project. In Visual Studio, in the "Solution Explorer" pane, 
right-click either the console UI project or the MVC web UI project and select "Set as Startup Project."

5. Run the project (press F5 on the keyboard or the green arrow in Visual Studio) to see the demonstration.


*Instructions for projects without a console app/web app:

Database projects:
-Open the (database_name).publish.xml file in the "PublishLocations" folder, and click "Publish" to create the database
on the local MS SQL server.

Unit Testing projects:
-open the "Test Explorer" pane from the "Tests" tab at the top of Visual Studio. click "Run All" icon to run the unit tests.
