# GitHub-Portfolio
A public repository where potential employers can view my sample projects and review my C# skills. 

The titles of the Solutions are meant to be self descriptive and tell what the overall project
is intended to primarily demonstrate. 

Each Solution has it's own class library, and I have included a console app as well as an MVC web app in 
some projects to demonstrate output and functionality.
