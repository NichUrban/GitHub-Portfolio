# GitHub-Portfolio
A public repository where potential employers can view my sample projects and review my C# skills. 

Feel free to explore my different projects, which display skills I've learned then used to create my
own small practice projects. 

The titles of the C# projects/solutions are generally self descriptive and hint at what the project
is intended to demonstrate.
